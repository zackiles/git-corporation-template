# Core documents you still need to draft for a functioning Canadian corporation

These are the mandatory or standard internal documents every corp is expected to have but the government does NOT generate for you. You need six documents, nothing more, nothing less:

⸻

## 1. Bylaws

Defines how the corporation actually operates. Must cover:

• directors' powers  
• meetings/resolutions  
• officer roles  
• signing authority  
• share rules  
• indemnification  

This is the backbone.

⸻

## 2. Initial Directors Resolution

Acknowledges the first directors named in the Articles and sets their roles until an organizational resolution is passed. Super short.

⸻

## 3. Organizational (First) Resolution

This is the "birth certificate" of the corporation. It must:

• adopt the bylaws  
• appoint officers (CEO/President/Secretary/Treasurer—can be all you)  
• authorize issuing founder shares  
• set up banking authority  
• adopt share certificates and registers  

This is the document that legally transfers initial shares to you.

⸻

## 4. Founder Share Issuance Resolution

Specifies:

• number of shares issued to you  
• class of shares  
• consideration (usually $1 or $10, or "services rendered")  
• date of issuance  

Must link to the securities register.

⸻

## 5. Shareholder/Director Registers

Simple tables:

• Register of Directors  
• Register of Officers  
• Register of Shareholders  
• Securities (Share) Register  

You maintain these forever.

⸻

## 6. General Authorization to Issue Shares (the one you asked for)

Allows future share issuances without calling another organizational meeting. This is the document you'll use to justify issuing shares to your wife.

⸻

## Optional but smart

• Unanimous Shareholder Agreement (if there's more than one shareholder)  
• IP Assignment (if you'll use personal IP in the business)
