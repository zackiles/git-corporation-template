| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ERS** | Electronics Recycling Standard — EPRA/RQP baseline |
| **ERRP** | Electronics Reuse & Refurbishment Program |
| **R2** | Responsible Recycling — SERI-administered global standard |
| **e-Stewards** | Basel Action Network certification for responsible recycling |
| **RQO/RQP** | Recycler Qualification Office / Program — EPRA verification body |

R2 certification is a prerequisite for RQO approval under current ERS/ERRS requirements.
