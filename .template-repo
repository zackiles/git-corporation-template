# Template Repository Marker

This file indicates that this is the original template repository,
not a fork being used for an actual corporation.

When you fork this repository for your corporation:
1. Delete this file
2. Delete MAINTAINERS.md
3. Follow the setup guide in FORK-SETUP.md

This marker helps distinguish between:
- Template maintainers working on improving the templates
- Corporate secretaries managing a real minute book
